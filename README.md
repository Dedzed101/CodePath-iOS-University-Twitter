# Project 3 - Twitter Clone App

Twitter Clone App is a basic twitter app to read your tweets.

Time spent: roughly six hours spent in total. There was a period of difficulty wehn the cells wouldnt format correctly. I had to just delete the entire table view alltogether and start from scratch to fix it.
